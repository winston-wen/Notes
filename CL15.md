**DDH Problem:** Given cyclic group $$\left<g\right>$$ and elements $$a=g^x, b=g^y, c=g^z$$, decide whether $$z=xy\pmod n$$.

A ciphertext (or cipher-encoding) should be **indistinguishable** with uniform distribution.

**CL15 variant of Elgamal encryption:** $$m\rightarrow(g^r, h^rf^m)$$. Here, 

* DDH holds for $$\left<g\right>$$ whose order is unknown; and,
* $$\left<f\right>$$ is subgroup of $$\left<g\right>$$ whose DL problem is EASY order is prime $$p$$.

The DL problem is easy in $$\left<f\right>$$. There exists a `Solve` algorithm, which is a deterministic PPT algorithm that solves the DL problem in $$\left<f\right>$$. The "Pr" formula roughly says: the probability of $x=x'$, where $x$ is randomly generated and $$x'=\mathtt{Solve}(f^x)$$, is 1.

The DDH problem is hard in $$\left<g\right>$$ even with access to the `Solve` algorithm. The "Pr" formula roughly says: the probability that an adversary
